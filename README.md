## Example Results

- Ablation study about the affect of resampling strategy under varied mask on the PSV dataset. The best results are in red, and the second-best results are in blue. The results show our AsyDiffusion with neither resampling nor discriminator outperforms the existing resampling models by merely resorting to diffusion model for image inpainting.
